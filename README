DESCRIPTION
-----------

This project has several purposes.  Firstly, it was an attempt to gain a much
deeper understanding of PAM, from the inside out.  Secondly, Linux PAM's 
pam_mkhomedir didn't work for me on OpenSolaris.

The code is a mish-mash.  The template for the module itself comes 
from sample_open_session.c within OpenSolaris.  Furthermore, in trying to 
find the best way to create home directories I found a nice program file
within OpenSolaris that already did exactly what I needed, so I borrowed
that too, homedir.c.  That file depends on messages.h, so its included
here as well.

The Makefile expects Sun Studio (SUNWspro).



HOW TO USE IT
--------------

Copy the pam_mkhomedir.so.1 to /usr/lib/security, then symlink it to
pam_mkhomedir.so.  Add the following into /etc/pam.conf:

other   session required        pam_mkhomedir.so.1 

It will use /etc/skel for the user directory skeleton, this is not 
configurable.
